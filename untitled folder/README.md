# News Site

An assignent to practice creating a responsive web page with the looks as a newspaper site. 

## The problem

I made a plan on a paper. And then my first goal was to create a shell that i could build on. 

I used CSS grid as a tool to create the cards and choose the number of columns as i wanted for the different viewports. Inside the cards I used Flexbox to create a layout for the content. For some cards I was struggeling with the images, i could't find a good size that was working with the responsive page. I realised that i could fix the problem with CSS grid much easier, so that solved the image problem and help me fill up the card much better.

I used the inspector in the web browser a lot during this assignment. I used it to try different ideas and see the instant change and then i copied into my code. It was a total aha-moment when i found out how useful that was!

I didn't put much time to focus on the design och the content itself because i wanted to use that time to do the rest of the pre-course. I would like to try more special fonts and get better at understanding the styling of fonts. I also would like to play around with more effects and how to create more/less content that is only showed in different viewports (more links in the desktop-view for example).
